# KiteCMS
Free XML based CMS

Thank you for trying KiteCMS.
This system started as a licensed product, but now I am setting it free for all to use.
When you have downloaded the files, have your default website point to the "KiteCMS" folder and start Visual Studio as an administrator.
There is an online demo running at http://demo.kitecms.com/
